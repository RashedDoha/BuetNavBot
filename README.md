# BuetNavBot
The android application of my level 3 term 1 project as during my undergrad studies at BUET.

The code is made open source to assist future students and to serve as a reference for similar projects.

The app simply connects to a bluetooth serial module and runs a thread to check for incoming messages.

The app also uses the main thread to draw a map that portrays the robot's movement along it's path.

In the inital stage, slight deviations in motion are assumed negligible by the app and only sharp turns are considered to be mapped.

To notify the detection of a human body and it's location, a circle is drawn on the map.

Feel free to contribute and extend features. Thank you and I hope you found this helpful.
